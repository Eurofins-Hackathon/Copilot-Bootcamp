# Copilot Bootcamp
The "Copilot Bootcamp" is a fundamentals focused program designed to enhance coding skills by introducing and exploring GitHub Copilot. This session is tailored to provide a comprehensive understanding of GitHub Copilot's features and its integration in coding practices.

Participants will learn about AI basics, ethical considerations in AI use, and the practical applications of GitHub Copilot in coding. This includes exploring code autocompletion, unit test generation, and effective documentation practices. The session progresses into advanced coding techniques with Copilot, such as debugging, refactoring, and prompt engineering, culminating in a hands-on lab

- Session 1 (1 hour) focuses on AI basics, its history, ethical considerations, and introduces GitHub Copilot as an AI-powered coding assistant.

- Session 2 (1 hour) explores GitHub Copilot's features like code autocompletion, test generation, and documentation best practices.

- Session 3 (1 hour) covers advanced techniques such as debugging, refactoring, and prompt engineering with Copilot, including a practical lab session.

This fundamentals session is ideal for developers eager to leverage AI technology to elevate their coding capabilities through the use of GitHub Copilot.

## Labs Prerequisites
Ensure the following for a smooth GitHub Copilot experience in Visual Studio Code:

- [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sign up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/) (if you don't already have one)
- Install GitHub Copilot extensions from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/):
  - GitHub Copilot v1.143.0 or higher
  - GitHub Copilot Chat v0.12.2023120701 or higher
- Sign in to GitHub within VS Code to enable Copilot features
- Clone reference app **eShopOnWeb** from [https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb)
- Maintain a stable internet connection (Copilot relies on cloud-based services)
- If you haven't previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, you're prompted to sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code. Select Sign in to GitHub.

  ##### Managing GitHub Copilot in VS Code
  - The Copilot Status Menu, located in the bottom panel of the Visual Studio Code window, allows you to enable or disable GitHub Copilot.
  - You can choose to disable suggestions globally (`Disable Globally`), or for the language of the file you're currently editing (`Disable for LANGUAGE`).

  ##### Diagnosing Issues with GitHub Copilot
  - Log files, stored in the standard location for Visual Studio Code extensions, can help diagnose connection issues.
  - To access these logs, open the Command Palette (Shift+Command+P for Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P for Windows/Linux), type `Diagnostics`, and select `GitHub Copilot: Collect Diagnostics`.
