# Copilot Bootcamp
The "Copilot Bootcamp" is a comprehensive, three-hour session training program designed to enhance coding proficiency with AI integration.

- Session 1 (1 hour) focuses on AI basics, its history, ethical considerations, and introduces GitHub Copilot as an AI-powered coding assistant.

- Session 2 (1 hour) explores GitHub Copilot's features like code autocompletion, test generation, and documentation best practices.

- Session 3 (1 hour) covers advanced techniques such as debugging, refactoring, and prompt engineering with Copilot, including a practical lab session.

Ideal for developers looking to enhance their coding with AI.
