# Lab 4.2 - Flight Data Recorder ✈ Capturing and Analyzing Code Changes
This lab exercise demonstrates integrating GitHub Copilot into database development and testing by implementing audit logging, query optimization, and data integrity checks. Participants will explore how AI-powered assistance enhances flight data tracking, debugging workflows, and maintaining historical records in an aviation-themed database.

## Prerequisites
- The prerequisites steps must be completed, see [Labs Prerequisites](../Lab%201.1%20-%20Pre-Flight%20Checklist/README.md)

## Estimated time to complete

- 20 min, times may vary with optional labs.

## Objectives

- This lab series guides participants through designing, optimizing, and testing an aviation-themed database while leveraging GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted development. By the end of these exercises, participants will have built a fully functional, well-structured aviation database with realistic data, optimized queries, and automated testing.
    - Step 1 - Blueprinting the Aviation Database ✈ Defining the schema and relationships
    - Step 2 - Refining the Flight Plan ✈ Optimizing table structure and improving data relationships
    - Step 3 - Filling the Logbook with Historical Data ✈ Generating realistic Wright Brothers aviation test data
    - Step 4 - Simulating Flight Operations ✈ Creating randomized flight records linked to pilots, planes, and airfields
    - Step 5 - Navigating Flight Details ✈ Developing a stored procedure for retrieving flight information
    - Step 6 - Turbocharging Flight Scheduling ✈ Optimizing query performance with indexing
    - Step 7 - Flight Readiness Check with Automated Testing ✈ Implementing tSQLt to verify database operations
