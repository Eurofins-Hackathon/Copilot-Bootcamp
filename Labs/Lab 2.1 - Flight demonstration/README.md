# Flight demonstration: Basic Coding with Copilot Assistance
This lab exercise covers ...

## Prerequisites
- The prerequisites steps are completed, see [Labs Prerequisites](https://github.com/XpiritBV/Copilot-Bootcamp#labs-prerequisites)

## Estimated time to complete
- 30 min

## Objectives
- Simple coding exercises using GitHub Copilot, focusing on understanding its suggestions and capabilities.
- Pair programming: One 'pilot' codes, the other guides using Copilot's suggestions.

### Required

#### Lab 3.1 Lay of the land - Explain the Codebase with Copilot Chat

- `@Workspace explain the application`

#### Lab 3.2 Test Flight - Autocompletion and Suggestions

- `PlaceController.cs` - `HttpPut` and `HttpDelete`


#### Lab 3.3 Test Flight Accelerate - Comment to Code

-  `HttpGet("searchByName")` to show how comments can be transformed into functional code. This illustrates Copilotâ€™s ability to interpret and execute descriptive comments.

### Optional

#### Lab 3.4 Testing your flying style - Logging - Consistency

-  Adding the Logger Example. Present a code completion task for adding a logger with specific syntax (e.g., _logger). Use this to explain how Copilot adapts to and replicates your coding style.
