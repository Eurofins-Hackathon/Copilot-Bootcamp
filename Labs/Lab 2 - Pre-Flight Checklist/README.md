#### Lab 2.0 ‚Äê Getting Familiar with GitHub and Setting Up Your Repository
Compare this to "Preparing Your Travel Itinerary, Checking Passport, Printing Boarding Pass". Just as travelers plan their journey, participants will set up their GitHub repository, planning their coding journey.

In this Hands-On Lab, you will learn how to navigate GitHub, create a new issue and obtain your own GitHub repo with the code for these hands-on labs. You will be working on your own repo in the following labs.

1. Clone your own repo `Microsoft-Bootcamp/attendee-repo`


#### Lab 2.1 Getting Started with Codespace
Frame this as "Boarding Your Flight". Codespace can be likened to the airplane, where participants will spend their time coding. Emphasize that they are now 'boarding' their main tool for the journey.

1. Start the `.devcontainer`

2. In GitHub.com
2. Locally in VSCode

#### Lab 2.2 Redeem Your Copilot Coupon
Redeem Your Copilot Coupon. Treat this like "Upgrading Your Flight Experience". Redeeming the Copilot coupon enhances their coding journey, similar to getting a flight upgrade.
