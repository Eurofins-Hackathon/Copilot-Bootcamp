# Turbulence in Code: Troubleshooting and Fine-Tuning
This lab exercise covers ...

## Prerequisites
- The prerequisites steps are completed, see [Labs Prerequisites](https://github.com/XpiritBV/Copilot-Bootcamp#labs-prerequisites)

## Estimated time to complete
- 30 min

## Objectives
- Understanding the limitations of GitHub Copilot and learning how to troubleshoot its suggestions.
- Group challenge to fix a set of buggy codes using Copilot, highlighting the importance of human oversight.

### Required

#### Lab 6.1 - Flight Crash Investigation - Fuel Depletion Scenario

o	Simulate a plane taking off with a method named [HttpPost] PlaneTakeOff.
o	Introduce a crash scenario due to fuel running out, resulting in a specific exception.
o	Utilize the Terminal Magic icon to diagnose and understand the exception. Explore other Copilot techniques for troubleshooting.

#### Lab 6.2 - Unexpected Flight Crash - Engine Failure Simulation

o	Create a simulation of an engine failure in the application.
o	Handle the unexpected crash of the .NET application due to this simulated engine failure.
o	Use Copilot to debug and resolve the issue, restoring application functionality.


#### Lab 6.3 - Flight Plan Adjustments - Codebase Improvements

o	Engage in a chat with Copilot to discuss potential improvements in the codebase or selected sections of code.
o	Introduce a context file to instruct Copilot on what to do and not to do, possibly aligning with company guidelines.
o	Gradually apply Copilot's suggestions to the code. Consider using a .copilotignore file to refine Copilot's focus.
o	Keep code quality reference files open for guidance and comparison.

### Optional

#### Lab 6.4 - Aerodynamics of an Airplane - Performance Optimization

o	Start with poorly performing code that incorporates common bad practices.
o	Use Copilot to enhance the code's performance.
o	Optimize a specific piece of code to run significantly faster (e.g., reduce execution time from 10 seconds to 1 second).


#### Lab 6.5 - Mastering Copilot - 10,000 Flight Hours Principle


o	Discuss the 10,000 Flight Hours concept as it applies to mastering Copilot.
	Originally popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his book "Outliers," posits that it takes roughly 10,000 hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field.
	When applying this concept to mastering GitHub Copilot or any advanced software tool, it suggests that becoming proficient with Copilot involves substantial practice and experience.
o	Provide pro tips, dos and don’ts, and best practices for using Copilot effectively.
