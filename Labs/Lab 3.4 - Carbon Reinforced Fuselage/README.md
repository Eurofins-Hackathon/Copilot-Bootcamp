# Lab 3.4 - Carbon Reinforced Fuselage ✈ Hardening the frontend
This lab focuses on configuring eslint to identify and fix lint issues, updating package dependencies, and optionally creating a Playwright UI Test project. 

## Prerequisites
- The prerequisites steps must be completed, see [Labs Prerequisites](./Labs/Lab%201.1%20-%20Pre-Flight%20Checklist)

## Estimated time to complete
- 20 minutes, times may vary with optional labs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure error-free results by meticulously following each step of the lab instructions.

## Objectives
- This lab focuses on configuring ESLint for identifying and resolving lint issues, updating package dependencies, and optionally setting up a Playwright UI testing project

    ### Journey
    - Step 1: Eslint configuration and fix lint issues.
    - Step 2: Upgrade to Business Class - Update Package Dependencies.
    - Step 3: PlayWright UI Test project using **/new** command.

### Step 1: Eslint configuration and fix lint issues

- In this lab, we will configure eslint and fix lint issues in the WrightBrothersFrontend project. eslint is a tool that helps you find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. It is similar to Roslyn Analyzer in the .NET.

- Close any files that are opened.

- From the `WrightBrothersFrontend/` directory, run the following command to see the current lint issues

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

- No lint issues should be present.

- Open the `WrightBrothersFrontend/.eslintrc.cjs` file.

- Notice the lint rules are the recommended rules from `eslint` and `react`. We want to add more lint rules to harden the project.

- Open GitHub Copilot Chat, then click `+` to clear prompt history.

- Select all the contents of the `.eslintrc.cjs` file.

- Type the following in the chat window:

    ```
    What linting rules can I add to #selection to harden my project more and tell me why for each? Only give me rules that are not already part of the recommended rules.
    ```

- Press `Enter` to submit the question

- GitHub Copilot suggested the following rules:

```js
module.exports = {
  // existing configuration...
  rules: {
    // existing rules...
    "no-console": "error",
    "eqeqeq": "error",
    "curly": "error",
    "no-eval": "error",
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
  },
};
```

>[!NOTE]
> Note that GitHub Copilot now suggested rules and also provided a reason to why implement a specific rule. This is a great way to learn more about the rules and why they are important.

- In the Copilot Chat window, click `Insert at Cursor` or `Apply in Editor`.

- When using `Apply in Editor`, be sure to click `Accept Changes` for each change.

```js
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  env: { browser: true, es2020: true },
  extends: [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
  ],
  ignorePatterns: ["dist", ".eslintrc.cjs"],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  plugins: ["react-refresh"],
  rules: {
    "react-refresh/only-export-components": [
      "warn",
      { allowConstantExport: true },
    ],
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off",
    "no-console": "warn",
    "eqeqeq": ["error", "always"],
    "curly": ["error", "all"],
    "no-unused-vars": ["error", { "args": "none" }],
    "no-var": "error",
    "prefer-const": "error",
    "react/jsx-uses-react": "error",
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "error",
    "react/prop-types": "error",
  },
};
```

</details>

<Br>  

- Run `npm run lint` to scan for lint issues with the new rules

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ````

- You should now see many lint issues related to the new rules

```bash
/Copilot-Bootcamp/WrightBrothersFrontend/src/pages/PlaneDetail.tsx
  77:16  error  Expected '===' and instead saw '=='  eqeqeq
  87:5   error  Expected { after 'if' condition      curly

/Copilot-Bootcamp/WrightBrothersFrontend/src/services/PlaneService.ts
  12:5  error  Unexpected console statement  no-console
```

- Ask Copilot to fix the lint issues

- Go to the lint issues in `WrightBrothersFrontend/src/pages/PlaneDetail.tsx`.

- Find the following code snippet that contains the `eqeqeq` lint issue:

```tsx
  if (!planeDetails)
    return <div>Plane not found</div>;
```

- `Right-click` on the first lint issue and select `/Fix` to fix using Copilot from the context menu.

  <img src="../../Images/Screenshot-FixUsingCopilot.png" width="700">

- GitHub Copilot will now open a Inline Editor window with the suggested fix. Review the fix and click `Accept` to apply the fix.

- Repeat for the other lint issues. You can also try `Explain using Copilot` to understand why the rule is important.

### Step 2: Navigating the Touch Screen - Visual Component Testing

- In this lab, we will create visual component tests for the PlaneList component in the WrightBrothersFrontend project. Visual component testing is a new way of testing the interaction and appearance of components in isolation.

- Open GitHub Copilot Chat, then click `+` to clear prompt history.

- For these tests we are using Playwright, a tool for automating browsers. Playwright is similar to Selenium but with a more modern API and better performance.

- Let's first run the existing tests in the project. Run `npm run test-ct` (component test) to see the existing tests pass.

  ```bash
  cd WrightBrothersFrontend/
  ```

  ```bash
  npm run test-ct
  ```

- You should see that all tests pass

  ```sh
  Running 2 tests using 2 workers
    2 passed (4.8s)
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter any of the following errors, follow the provided steps to resolve them:

- Error: `browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist.` 
  - This error indicates a problem with your Playwright installation. Please check your installation and fix any issues before proceeding.

- Error: `Looks like Playwright Test or Playwright was just installed or updated.`
  - This error usually occurs after a new installation or update of Playwright. If you see this, try running the command below to install the necessary Playwright dependencies:

  ```bash
  npx playwright install
  ```

  - Try again, run the existing tests in the project. Run `npm run test-ct` (component test) to see the existing tests pass.

  ```sh
  npm run test-ct
  ```

- We are going to add tests to the already existing `PlaneList.spec.tsx` file in the `src/components` folder.

- Open GitHub Copilot `Edits` (Ctrl+Shift+I) (icon with + on it next to Copilot Chat), then click `+` for `New Edit Session`.

- Add the following files to the `Working Set` near the bottom of Copilot Edits window.

- Click the `+ Add files` button, then select these:
    - `PlaneList.tsx`
    - `PlaneList.spec.tsx`

> [!NOTE]
> You can multi-select these files from the file explorer by holding the `Ctrl` down and `Left-Clicking` on each file. Then simply drag-n-drop them into Copilot Edits working set window.

- Copy/Paste the following in the Copilot Edits Chat window:

    ```
    Create the remaining tests for #file:PlaneList.tsx based on test file #file:PlaneList.spec.tsx
    ```
  
>[!NOTE]
> If the result is incomplete or doesn't work, simply retry the prompt.

<img src="../../Images/Screenshot-PlaneList.spec.png" width="600">

- Press `Enter` to submit the prompt.

- You can choose to `Accept` or `Discard` the changes in the file editor or the `Working Set` window.

- Copilot used `PlaneList.tsx` to match the style of the form to the existing `<PlaneList />` component.

- Then new tests were added to `PlaneList.spec.tsx`.

- Click `Accept` to save the changes, then click `Done` in the `Copilot Edits` window to complete this task.

- If Copilot didn't suggest the code above, then update the code manually as follows:

- The created tests do not always compile. GitHub Copilot got you 90% of the way there, but you may need to make some adjustments to the code to make it work. You can also ask Copilot for help with this. Try `Fix using Copilot` or `Explain using Copilot` to get help with the code.

- Now run the tests again but then with the UI open

  ```sh
  npm run test-ct:open
  ```

- In a DevContainer or CodeSpace you might see the following error:

  ```sh
    '╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n' +
    '║ Looks like you launched a headed browser without having a XServer running.                     ║\n' +
    "║ Set either 'headless: true' or use 'xvfb-run <your-playwright-app>' before running Playwright. ║\n" +
    '║                                                                                                ║\n' +
    '║ <3 Playwright Team                                                                             ║\n' +
    '╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝'
  ```

- Run the following command to run the tests without the UI

  ```sh
  npm run test-ct
  ```

- You should see the tests in the PlayWright UI. You can press the play button in the UI to run the tests.

- You should see that all tests pass

  ```sh
  Running 2 tests using 2 workers
    2 passed (4.8s)
  ```

- Not all tests will pass. You can now debug the tests in the PlayWright UI and fine-tune the tests to make them pass.

- Now stop the Frontend and API by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Optional

### Step 3: PlayWright UI Test project using **/new** command

- In this lab, we will create a new Playwright UI Test project using the **/new** command in GitHub Copilot.

- If you have not already done the lab for creating a form with GitHub Copilot. Copy/paste the following code inside `/WrightBrothersFrontend/src/pages/NewPlane.tsx`

- First, Make sure that the Frontend is running. This is because the Playwright UI Test project will interact with the Frontend.

  ```bash
  cd WrightBrothersFrontend/
  ```

  ```bash
  npm run frontend-and-backend
  ```

  ```bash
  npm run test-ct
  ```

  - If you haven't done so already, we need to make port `1903` public instead of private to allow access to list of planes.

    - Click the `PORTS` button (near bottom center).

    - With your cursor over port 1903, `Right-Click`, select `Port Visability`, then click `Public`.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Making port 1903 public is necessary to allow external access to the service running on that port. In this context, the service provides a list of planes, and making the port public ensures that users can access this information from outside the local development environment (a Codespace).

- Open the browser and navigate to your URL `/new-plane`.
  - i.e. `https://super-duper-space-robot-4v6rvqwggx25xq7-5173.app.github.dev/new-plane`

- Open GitHub Copilot Chat, then click `+` to clear prompt history.

- Type the following in the chat window:

  ```md
  @workspace /new Playwright UI Tests
  
  ## Purpose
  I want to create a new Playwright UI Test project to test the form at "/new-plane".
  
  ## Test
  - Navigate to "/new-plane" and fill out the form through the "name" attribute: id, name, year, description, rangeInKm
  
  ## Technical Requirements
  - UI mode
  - localhost:5173 is the base URL
  - Typescript
  - Include package.json
  - Use @playwright/test library
  
  ## Folder Structure
  - Parent Folder: WrightBrothersFrontend/
  
  Make a complete solution.
  ```

- Press `Enter` to submit the question

- GitHub Copilot will now scaffold a new Playwright UI Test project

- Click `Create Workspace` to create the new Playwright UI Test project.

  <img src="../../Images/Screenshot-PlaywrightUITestProject.png" width="350">

- Select the `WrightBrothersFrontend/` as the `Parent Folder` to create the new project.

- GitHub Copilot will now open the new project in a new window.

- Now stop the Frontend and API by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

- Open the terminal and navigate to the `WrightBrothersFrontend/<new folder created>` directory.

  - i.e. `cd WrightBrothersFrontend/playwright-ui-testing`

    ```bash
    cd WrightBrothersFrontend/playwright-ui-testing
    ```


  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Now, run the tests

  ```sh
  npm run test
  ```

- The tests fail, because most likely playwright needs to install additional dependencies, run the following command to install the dependencies

  ```sh
  npx playwright install 
  ```

- Now, run the tests again, but now with the UI open to see the tests run in the Playwright UI

  ```sh
  npm run test --ui
  ```

- You should see the tests pass in the UI or in the terminal

  ```sh
  Running 1 test using 1 worker
    ✓ 1. should navigate to /new-plane and fill out the form (1.5s)
  ```

- GitHub Copilot just created a new Playwright UI Test project for you with successful tests. You can now use this project to create more tests for the WrightBrothersFrontend project.

### Congratulations you've made it to the end! &#9992; &#9992; &#9992;
